                        Just downstream, the Middle Fork flows through Tunnel Chute, where the river races through a man-made tunnel blasted out during the California Gold Rush, in order to dewater part of the river bed for mining.

                        The North Fork American River is the longest branch of the American River in Northern California. It is 88 miles (142 km) long from its source at the crest of the Sierra Nevada, near Lake Tahoe, to its mouth at Folsom Lake northeast of Sacramento.

                    <h6 class="river_descriptions">
                        The North Fork American is the most difficult of the three Forks. Towering Cliffs and 2000 foot canyon walls spotted with black oaks and varying pines sets the back drop of one of the most beautiful California whitewater rafting river canyons. Located near Interstate 80, near the city of Auburn, the North Fork is easily accessible with some camping options nearby.

                    <h6 class="river_descriptions">
                        The North Fork American, with no dams upstream, is truly a wild river. It can be run by raft, canoe, or kayak in winter and spring only, when water exceeds about 900 cubic feet per second (cfs). At all levels, the river is Class IV with little rescue access. The North Fork American is a highly technical river. It should only be attempted by very experienced whitewater boaters who have seen its rapids before. A mile-by-mile guide cannot replace the judgment of each individual boater
